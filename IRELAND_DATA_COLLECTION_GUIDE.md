## Final Notes

### Data Reliability Scoring
Use this internally to track confidence:
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Official government source, current, verified
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Official source, slightly outdated (3-6 months)
- ⭐⭐⭐ Semi-official or professional source, cross-referenced
- ⭐⭐ Third-party data, should be updated
- ⭐ Crowdsourced, needs verification

### When in Doubt
1. Check official sources first
2. Email relevant government department
3. Call INIS customer service (+353 1 616 7700)
4. Mark as "NEEDS_VERIFICATION" if uncertain
5. Never guess - accuracy is critical for users' life decisions

### Remember
- Users' immigration decisions depend on this data
- Error in visa fees is inconvenient; error in eligibility is life-changing
- When in doubt, mark for verification rather than publish incorrect info
- Always provide source URLs so users can verify themselves
