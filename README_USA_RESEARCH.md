## 🎯 Key Findings Summary

### 🔴 CRITICAL 2025 UPDATE

**H-1B Visa $100,000 Fee** (Effective September 21, 2025)

Presidential Proclamation requires **$100,000 petition fee** for new H-1B petitions filed after September 21, 2025 (in addition to regular $2,000-7,000 fees).

**Impact:** Makes H-1B economically unfeasible for most employers. **This fundamentally changes USA immigration strategy.**

**New recommended path:** F-1 Student → OPT/STEM OPT → Direct Green Card (skip H-1B entirely)

### Top 5 Takeaways

1. **💰 Highest salaries in world** - Software engineers earn $80K-400K+ (vs €50K-90K in Germany, 20K-35K PLN in Poland)

2. **⚠️ H-1B no longer viable** - $100,000 fee makes it almost impossible. L-1, O-1, or student path required.

3. **🟢 Fast Green Card for Turkish citizens** - EB-1 is CURRENT (no wait), EB-2 only ~2 years (vs 8-10 years for Indians)

4. **🎓 Student path is best for most** - F-1 visa + STEM OPT (36 months) provides reliable entry and work experience

5. **💵 Very expensive but proportional** - Cost of living is 2-3x higher than Europe, but salaries are also 2-3x higher

### Biggest Advantages

✅ **Unmatched salaries** - Nowhere else pays as much
✅ **Best job market** - Especially tech and STEM
✅ **Large Turkish community** - 350K+ support network
✅ **Dual citizenship** - Can keep Turkish passport
✅ **Fast Green Card** - Turkish citizens wait much less than India/China
✅ **OPT work authorization** - 3 years for STEM graduates

### Biggest Challenges

❌ **Extremely expensive** - Healthcare, education, housing all very costly
❌ **H-1B $100K fee** - Work visa sponsorship nearly impossible now
❌ **Healthcare system** - Complex and can be financially devastating
❌ **High education costs** - $40K-120K/year for university
❌ **Long process** - 5-10 years from start to Green Card
❌ **Car culture** - Car required in most cities

## ⚠️ Important Updates for 2025

### September 2025: H-1B Petition Fee

**Presidential Proclamation (September 19, 2025):**
- **$100,000 fee** for new H-1B petitions filed on/after September 21, 2025
- Does NOT apply to renewals/extensions
- Exemptions possible for national interest cases (very rare)

**Impact on Turkish citizens:**
- H-1B lottery is no longer a viable primary strategy
- Focus on: F-1→OPT, L-1, O-1, or direct Green Card paths

### May 2025: New Visa Appointment System (Turkey)

US Embassy Turkey began using new visa appointment system from new provider on May 30, 2025.

**Website:** https://ais.usvisa-info.com/en-tr/niv

### FY 2025: L-1 Visa Integrity Fee

Starting October 1, 2025: **$250 visa integrity fee** for L-1 visas (paid at visa issuance)

### November 2025: Priority Dates

**For Turkish Citizens (Rest of World):**
- EB-1: CURRENT (all subcategories)
- EB-2: December 1, 2023 (~2 year wait)
- EB-3: April 1, 2023 (~2.5 year wait)
