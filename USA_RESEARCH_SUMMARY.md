The United States offers **the world's highest salaries** for skilled professionals, particularly in technology and STEM fields, but with **very high cost of living** and **complex immigration system**. The recent **$100,000 H-1B petition fee** (effective September 2025) has dramatically changed the work visa landscape.

## 💼 Work Visa Paths

**Presidential Proclamation (September 19, 2025):** New H-1B petitions filed after September 21, 2025 must include $100,000 petition fee.

This makes H-1B **economically unfeasible** for most employers and employees.

### H-1B Specialty Occupation Visa (Traditional Path - NOW VERY DIFFICULT)

- **NEW 2025:** $250 visa integrity fee starting October 2025
- **Path to Green Card:** EB-1C for L-1A (very fast - usually current for Turkish citizens)

**Perfect for:**
- Employees of Turkish companies with US operations
- Employees of multinationals with offices in both Turkey and USA
- Turkish startup founders establishing US presence

### O-1 Extraordinary Ability - FOR EXCEPTIONAL TALENT

**Status:** ✅ **NO lottery, NO cap, NO $100k fee**

For individuals with extraordinary ability in sciences, arts, education, business, athletics.

2. **Choose STEM major** for 3-year OPT (computer science, engineering, data science)
3. **Apply to DV Lottery every year** (free backup option)
4. **Save aggressively** - you'll need $50,000-100,000+ for first year (tuition + living)

### During Studies/OPT

5. **Network intensively** - USA is all about networking
6. **Join Turkish student associations** - lifelong connections
7. **Intern at companies** that sponsor Green Cards
8. **Start building credit immediately** with secured credit card
9. **Get driver's license** even in cities with transit (needed for ID)

### Job Search

10. **Target large companies** - more likely to sponsor (pre-2025 for H-1B, still true for Green Card)
11. **Emphasize specialized skills** - harder to find US workers
12. **Use Turkish professional networks** - TASSA, local associations
13. **Consider L-1 route** if working for multinational
14. **For exceptional candidates:** Pursue O-1 or EB-1A

### Money Management

15. **Budget for healthcare** - insurance is non-negotiable
16. **Maximize 401(k) match** - free money from employer
17. **File taxes correctly** - hire CPA first year
18. **Build 6-month emergency fund** - things cost more than expected

### Settlement

19. **Connect with Turkish community ASAP** - practical help and social support
20. **Choose city wisely** - balance cost, jobs, Turkish community
21. **No-tax states** help a lot - Texas, Washington, Florida (no state income tax)
22. **Car vs transit** - NYC/Chicago/Boston/DC/SF = transit OK; rest = need car

## 🔥 2025 Special Considerations

### H-1B $100,000 Fee Impact

The September 2025 H-1B fee has **fundamentally changed** the immigration landscape:

- ❌ H-1B is no longer viable for most cases
- ✅ F-1 → OPT path is NOW even more important
- ✅ L-1 visa is now the best employer-sponsored option
- ✅ O-1 visa for exceptional talent (no fee)
- ✅ Direct Green Card paths (EB-1, EB-2 NIW) more attractive

### Best Strategy for 2025 and Beyond:

1. **Student path (F-1)** for entry and 3-year OPT work authorization
2. **During OPT:** Employer sponsors **direct Green Card** (EB-2/EB-3) - skip H-1B entirely
3. **Alternative:** L-1 if working for multinational
4. **If exceptional:** O-1 or direct EB-1A Green Card

## ✅ Final Verdict for USA

### ⭐ Completeness: 95%

**Overall Rating: 9/10** for skilled professionals, **7/10** for average workers

**Bottom Line:** USA offers **unmatched career opportunities and salaries** for skilled Turkish professionals, particularly in tech and STEM fields. However, the **new $100,000 H-1B fee makes direct work visa sponsorship nearly impossible**. The **student path (F-1 → OPT → Green Card)** is now the **primary recommended route**. USA is **expensive** and has **complex immigration**, but the **large Turkish community** provides strong support. If you can afford the education costs and navigate the system, USA offers the **highest earning potential** in the world.

**Best for:** Tech professionals, STEM graduates, ambitious career-focused individuals, those who can afford US education
**Not ideal for:** Those seeking free education (→ Germany), those seeking fastest PR (→ Germany), those on tight budget (→ Poland)
